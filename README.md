# How Land Development Affects Water Pollution


This project explores the connection between the kinds of human activity that occurs within a given area (land use) and the type and extent of pollution in nearby water bodies. Using geographical data files from the Washington state government, water and land information is curated and assessed within this context. Land use is broken down into eight general categories, such as residential or industrial areas. Water pollution is separated by type of pollution. The final map will compare kinds of land use and kinds of water pollution to determine what sort of correlations and conclusions can be derived from the data.
