## Preparing Maps and Data for the Web

For my project, I anticipate that most of the data will be stored server-side and called upon when needed. Because the data files project to be large even after adjustment, performance will be best if the map is more static than dynamic. Instead, interactivity with the map will be facilitated by allowing the user to select for data that has already been properly curated.

Because of the nature of the datasets, I believe that Leaflet is most likely to be the best library for its display, using a mix of JSON and CSV data. Bootstrap will be used for the front-end display. The files will be kept in static form so that they can be presented in a way that fits the map. QGIS and Jupyter are being used to manipulate and create the data necessary for the final product.
